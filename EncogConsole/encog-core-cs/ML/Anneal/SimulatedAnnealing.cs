    /// Simulated annealing is a common training method. This class implements a
    /// simulated annealing algorithm that can be used both for neural networks, as
    /// well as more general cases. This class is abstract, so a more specialized
    /// simulated annealing subclass will need to be created for each intended use.
    /// This book demonstrates how to use the simulated annealing algorithm to train
    /// feedforward neural networks, as well as find a solution to the traveling
    /// salesman problem.
    /// The name and inspiration come from annealing in metallurgy, a technique
    /// involving heating and controlled cooling of a material to increase the size
    /// of its crystals and reduce their defects. The heat causes the atoms to become
    /// unstuck from their initial positions (a local minimum of the internal energy)
    /// and wander randomly through states of higher energy; the slow cooling gives
    /// them more chances of finding configurations with lower internal energy than
    /// the initial one.

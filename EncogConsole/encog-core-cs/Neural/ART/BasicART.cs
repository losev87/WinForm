    /// Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) is a form of neural network developed 
    /// by Stephen Grossberg and Gail Carpenter. There are several versions 
    /// of the ART neural network, which are numbered ART-1, ART-2 and ART-3. 
    /// The ART neural network is trained using either a supervised or 
    /// unsupervised learning algorithm, depending on the version of ART being 
    /// used. ART neural networks are used for pattern recognition and prediction.
    /// Plasticity is an important part for all Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) 
    /// neural networks. Unlike most neural networks, ART networks do not have 
    /// a distinct training and usage stage. The ART network will learn as it is 
    /// used.

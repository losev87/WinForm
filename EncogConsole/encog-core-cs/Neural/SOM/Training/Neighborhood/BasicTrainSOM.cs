    /// set. If ideal data is provided, it will be ignored.
    /// Training is done by looping over all of the training elements and calculating
    /// a "best matching unit" (BMU). This BMU output neuron is then adjusted to
    /// better "learn" this pattern. Additionally, this training may be applied to
    /// other "nearby" output neurons. The degree to which nearby neurons are update
    /// is defined by the neighborhood function.
    /// A neighborhood function is required to determine the degree to which
    /// neighboring neurons (to the winning neuron) are updated by each training
    /// iteration.
    /// Because this is unsupervised training, calculating an error to measure
    /// progress by is difficult. The error is defined to be the "worst", or longest,
    /// Euclidean distance of any of the BMU's. This value should be minimized, as
    /// learning progresses.

    /// up with some output neurons that learn nothing. By default these neurons are
